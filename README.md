3.	data pre-processing and text cleaning
4.	Training the word2vec model using skills of the linkedIn users
5.	Made two types of graph relationships for users
6.	First using their common skill set using word2vec embeddings
a.	Created graph visuals for 94%, 95% and 98% above similarity rate of linked In users common skills
7.	Second, we created links between users on the basis of their positions in different companies.
8.	Visualize the communities using networkx graph library.
